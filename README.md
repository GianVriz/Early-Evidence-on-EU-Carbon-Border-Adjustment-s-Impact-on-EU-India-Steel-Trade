# Abstract

This study examines early signals of the EU CBAM’s potential impact on iron and steel exporters in India by integrating firm-level export data with third- party estimates of manufacturers’ emissions and production. Changes in trade flows and pricing during the CBAM reporting phase indicate that high-emission- intensity firms have decreased both their average unit prices and shipment sizes to the EU, while low-emission-intensity firms have not changed shipment behavior but may have benefited from increasing prices. Such supply chain adjustments are in line with the policy’s intentions, creating opportunities for low-emission producers while reducing reliance on high-emission suppliers to the EU
